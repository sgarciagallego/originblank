        <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>
        <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> Some information – such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics – is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</em></p>
        <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
        <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
        <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li><em>Log and usage data.</em> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called &apos;crash dumps&apos;), and hardware settings).</li>
          <li><em>Device Data.</em> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</li>
          <li><em>Location data.</em> We collect location data such as information about your device&apos;s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. How do we process your information?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</em></p>

        </ul>
        <h2>3. What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil legitimate business interests.</em></p>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
            <ul role="list">
              <li>Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users.</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Legal obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
          <li><strong>Vital interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as in situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. When and with whom do we share your personal information?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents (&apos;<strong>third parties</strong>&apos;) who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything about your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. The third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>
            <p><strong>Web and Mobile Analytics:</strong></p>
            <p>Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and Hotjar.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
          <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honour this privacy policy. Affiliates include joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may share your information with our business partners to offer certain products, services, or promotions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
        <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. If you do not agree with our cookies and tracking technologies, please do not use our Services</p>
        <h2>6. How long do we keep your information?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us to keep your personal information for longer than 2 years.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <h2>7. How do we keep your information safe?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisation security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmissions over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. We should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
        <h2>8. Do we collect information from minors?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&apos;s use of Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under the age of 18, please contact us using the email found in chapter 12.</p>
        <h2>9. What are your privacy rights?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>
        <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be a subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us using the email found in chapter 12.</p>
        <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Member State data protection authority</a> or <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UK data protection authority</a>.</p>
        <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the email found in chapter 12.</p>
        <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.</p>
        <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us.</p>
        <h2>10. Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preferences not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about the practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>
        <h2>11. Do we make updates to this notice?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em></p>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated &apos;Revised&apos; date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a policy of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
